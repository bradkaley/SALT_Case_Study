# **SALT Case Study**

## *Overview and Origin*

SALT, also called SALT Lending or its legal name Salt Blockchain Inc., was founded in 2016 [1,2]. SALT stands for Secured Automated Lending Technology [3]. The company was founded by a small group: Benjamin Yablon, Blake Cohen, Caleb Slade, and Shawn Owen [1].

The idea for SALT was to make loans accessible to more people and businesses by allowing them to get loans using their cryptocurrency as collateral. The borrower still owns the assets they use as collateral; therefore, by using SALT to get a loan they don't need to sell the assets in order to get the cash they need [3].

The company is privately funded with venture capital. The specifics of the total amount of funding are not publicly available, but records show that SALT has received at least $12 million in funding [5]. The company also raised $47 million with its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2017, but it had to offer refunds to investors by order of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) [2]. The reason for the SEC ruling was that SALT did not register the sale of its SALT token before the ICO and that the token should have been registered as a security [4].

## *Business Activities*

SALT's goal is to give both individuals and businesses across geographies/countries access to cash loans for whatever their goals are (e.g., large purchases or paying down debt) through the use of cryptocurrency. The customer base is really any individual or business that needs a loan and has available cryptocurrency to offer as collateral. The service allows the customer to retain ownership of their cryptocurrency when they receive the loan. Since SALT gains possession of the cryptocurrency and has the ability to liquidate them if the borrower defaults on the loan, there is no credit check required to get a loan. This opens the door for more people and businesses to gain access to loans through the use of their cryptocurrency compared to traditional lending routes [3,11].

SALT has many competitors in this space, some of which include BlockFi, Oasis Borrow, Compound Finance, Aave, Alchemix, Celsius Network, Nexo, Ledn, and Bankera [10,]. All of these companies are in competition with firms that offer traditional routes for loans, such as banks and mortgage companies.

SALT's competitors which offer loans backed by cryptocurrency utilize either custodial/centralized finance (CeFi) cryptocurrency loans or non-custodial/decentralized finance (DeFi) cryptocurrency loans. Both of these types use cryptocurrency as collateral, but in CeFi loans the lender controls the collateral (i.e., the customer does not have access to the private keys for the collateral) and in DeFi loans the borrower controls the collateral unless there is a default on the loan [10].

SALT offers DeFi crypto loans which utilize Ethereum ERC-20 smart contracts to execute and enforce the terms of the loan [3]. In order to get a loan with SALT, an individual or business needs to become a member and purchase at least one SALT Token which then gives them access to SALT's lending network [3]. At that point, the customer can deposit their cryptocurrency collateral to SALT's Oracle Wallet which facilitates the storage of the assets and execution and enforcement of the loan. Once the loan is repaid, the collateral is returned to the customer from the wallet [11]. SALT tokens can be used, but are not required, in the SALT environment to pay interest or fees, to deposit as collateral, or to obtain a lower interest rate [12].

SALT advertises the following advantages to using its service instead of its competitors (both cryptocurrency-based and traditional lenders):

* Competitive interest rates;
* No credit check due to the collateral that is used;
* Its own mobile app and customer support to manage the loan;
* No fee to start up the loan;
* No early repayment fees;
* Flexible loan term lengths and loan-to-value (LTV) ranges;
* Ability to receive (as the loan) or deposit (as the payment or collateral) stablecoins instead of fiat money; and
* Acceptance of a range of cryptocurrency as collateral (includes Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Dash) [3,13].

In addition, there is currently a waitlist for a SALT credit card which will allows customers to earn cryptocurrency rewards with purchases, similar to other credit cards that have rewards points [14]. This credit card will diversify SALT's product line, and it is similar to what other cryptocurrency companies are developing.

## *Industry Landscape*

SALT is part of the lending domain in the financial industry. The lending domain encompasses a variety of different types of loans, including mortgages, personal loans, and business loans. In the last 10 years, this domain/industry has been trending toward providing easier access to loans. In the past, the traditional loan process was slow and inundated with paperwork. Streamlining the process using online loan applications and automation allows for quicker loan application responses (approvals or denials) [6]. Nowadays, someone can apply for loans for just about anything right from their mobile phones and get responses quickly.

With this innovation and easier access to loans comes potentially higher fees, higher interest, or other caveats that need to be considered by customers. Specifically, for loans associated with cryptocurrency offered by SALT and its competitors, the customer needs to keep in mind that a decrease in the value of the cryptocurrency used for the loan's collateral can result in the lender requiring additional funds to cover the collateral's loss in value or cause the lender to liquidate the collateral if the loan defaults [3]. This is a new aspect to lending that did not previously need to be considered as part of traditional lending.

There is a plethora of companies in the lending domain since lending encompasses many types of loans. Some major companies in the industry, not including SALT and its competitors listed above, are as follows:

* Mortgages: Bank of America, U.S. Bank, Quicken Loans, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase [7];
* Personal Loans: SOFI, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, LightStream [8]; and
* Business Loans: BlueVine, OnDeck, TD Bank, Funding Circle [9].

## *Company Performance/Results*

SALT was pegged as a initial disruptor to the lending domain when it was founded in 2016, as it was founded around the same time or before all of the competitors listed in the 'Business Activities' section above [11]. Regardless of whether the trend toward loans backed by cryptocurrency was due entirely to SALT or if it was simply inevitable due to the growing acceptance and popularity of cryptocurrency, it cannot be denied that SALT was an early pioneer of the space. The work of SALT has helped to continue the trend of acceptance and usage of these types of assets, other than just for speculation.

The core metrics / key performance indicators (KPIs) by which companies in the cryptocurrency lending space are measured vary from those used for traditional lending companies. Although the ultimate goal of between cryptocurrency based lenders and traditional lenders is the same (i.e., provide a loan to a customer with the agreement that it will be repaid with interest), the loan processes are different which in turn affect the KPIs.  

Some of the KPIs for traditional lenders include pull through rate, decision to close time cycle, abandoned loan rate, average origination value, application approval rate, net charge off rate, customer acquisition cost, and average number of conditions per loan [16]. KPIs are not well defined for crypto lenders, especially since these companies have been operating for less than 5 years; however, some core KPIs that can be used for evaluating their performance are the average loan size, total amount of funds loaned, customer lifetime value (CLV), and product usage [17,18]. In the future as these companies develop further and ultimately mature (with potential for becoming publicly-traded firms, as Coinbase did), it is likely that a strong set of core KPIs will be developed and measured for companies across this domain.

## *Recommendations*

Based on the industry and other competitors, I would recommend SALT offer a cryptocurrency savings account option for individuals to earn annual interest, paid out in monthly installments. One of SALT's competitors, Ledn, has this service as part of its business model. This would benefit SALT by allowing them to create more assets under management which they could use to lend to either an institutional borrower, similar to Ledn [15], or to other customers (both individuals and businesses). This could ultimately increase revenue via interest payments from these additional loans.

Adding a savings account offering to customers would require SALT to create a second wallet system in which each customer's cryptocurrencies are stored for savings accounts. The amount and type of cryptocurrency stored in the savings account would be recorded on the blockchain, and customers would be able to withdraw their cryptocurrency if desired. As mentioned above, Ledn lends Bitcoin to a third party institutional borrower called Genesis and then receives interest payments from Genesis [15]. SALT could utilize this same strategy. Therefore, having the new wallet system and tracking customer deposits & withdrawals and borrower interest payments & loans, there should be minimal additional technology needed to offer this service.
