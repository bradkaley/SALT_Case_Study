# **SALT Case Study**

![Salt Image](salt.png)

## *Overview and Origin*

SALT, SALT Lending, or Salt Blockchain Inc. was founded in 2016 [1,2]. SALT stands for Secured Automated Lending Technology [3]. The company was founded by a group of four - Benjamin Yablon, Blake Cohen, Caleb Slade, and Shawn Owen [1].

The idea for SALT was to make loans accessible to more people and businesses by allowing them to get loans using their cryptocurrency or digital assets. The borrower still owns the asset they use as collateral, and they don't have to sell the assets to access the loan [3].

The company is privately funded with venture capital. The specifics of the total amount of funding are not publicly availablbe, but records show that SALT has received at least approximately $12.2 million in funding [5]. The company also raised $47 million with it's Initial Coin Offereing (ICO) in 2017, but it had to offer refunds to investors by order of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) [2]. The SEC ruled that SALT did not register the sale of its SALT token before the ICO and that the token should have been registered as a security [4].

## *Business Activities*

SALT's goal is to give both individuals and businesses across geographies/countries access to cash loans for whatever their goals are (e.g., large purchaes or paying down debt) through the use of digital assets or cryptocurrency. The customers range from individuals to businesses, and the service allows the customers to retain ownership of their digital assets and cryptocurrency when they receive the loan. Since SALT gains possession of the assets or cryptocurrency and can liquidate them if the borrower defaults on the loan, there is no credit check required to get a loan. This opens the door to more people and businesses to gain access to loans through the use of their crptocurrency or other digital assets compared to traditional routes of getting loans [3,11].

SALT has many competitors in this space, some of which include BlockFi, Oasis Borrow, Compound Finance, Aave, Alchemix, Celsius Network, Nexo, Ledn, and Bankera [10,]. All of these companies are in competition with the traditional banks that offer loans.

SALT's competitors which offer loans backed by cryptocurrency or digital assets utilize either custodial/centralized finance (CeFi) crypto loans or non-custodial/decentralized finance (DeFi) crypto loans. Both types use cryptocurrency and digital assets as collateral, but in a CeFi loans the lender controls the collateral (i.e., the customer does not have access to the private keys for the collateral) and in a DeFi loan the lender does not control the collateral unless there is a default on the loan [10].

SALT offers DeFi crypto loans which utilize Ethereum ERC-20 smart contracts to execute and enfore the terms of the loan [3]. In order to get a loan with SALT, an individual or business needs to apply to become a member and then purchase a SALT token to become a customer and gain access to SALT's lending network [3]. At that point, the customer can deposit their collateral, either crypotcurrency or digital assets, to SALT's Oracle Wallet for storage of the assets, and execution and enforcement of the loan. Once the loan is repaid, the collateral is returned to the customer from the wallet [11]. SALT tokens can be used in the SALT environemnt to pay interest or fees, to deposit as collateral, or to obtain a lower interest rate [12].

SALT advertises the following advantages to using its service instead of its competitors (both crypto-based and traditional lenders):

* Compeitive interest rates;
* No credit check;
* Its own mobile app to manage the loan, also with customer support;
* No fee to startup the loan;
* No early repayment fees;
* Flexible loan term lengths and loan-to-value (LTV) range;
* Ability to receive (as the loan) or deposit (as the payment or collateral) stablecoins instead of fiat money; and
* Acceptance of a range of cryptocurrency as collateral (Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Dash) [3,13].

In additon, there is currently a waitlist for a SALT credit card which will allows customers to earn cryptocurrency rewards, similar to other credit cards with rewards points for purchases [14]. This credit card will diversify SALT's product line, and it is similar to what other cryptocurrency comapnies are developing.

## *Industry Landscape*

SALT is part of the lending domain in the financial industry. The lending domain encompasses a variety of different loans, including mortgages, personal loans, and business loans. In the last 10 years or so, this domain/industry has been trending toward providing easier access to loans for individuals and businesses. In the past, the loan process for all types of loans was slow and inundated with paperwork. Streamlining the process using online loan applications allows for quicker responses (approvals or denials) for loans [6]. Nowadays, someone can apply for loans for just about anything right from their mobile phones and get responses quickly.

With the innovation and easier access with loans comes potentially higher fees, higher interest, or other caveats that need to be considered by customers. Specifically, with loans associated with cryptocurrency and digital assets offered by SALT and its competitors, the customer needs to keep in mind that a decrease in the value of the cryptocurrency or digitial assets used for the loan's collateral can cause the company to liquidate the collateral or require additional funds to cover the loss in value [3]. This is a new aspect to lending that did not previously need to be considered as part of traditional lending.

There are a plehtora of companies in the lending domain since lending encompasses many types of loans. Some major companies in the industry, not including SALT and its competitors listed above, are as follows:

* Mortgages: Bank of America, U.S. Bank, Quicken Loans, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase [7];
* Personal Loans: SOFI, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, LightStream [8]; and
* Business Loans: BlueVine, OnDeck, TD Bank, Funding Circle [9].

## *Company Performance/Results*

SALT was pegged as a disruptor when it was founded in 2016, as it was founded around the same time or before all of the competitors listed in the 'Business Activites' section above [11]. Regardless of whether the trend toward loans backed by cryptocurrency and digital assets was due entirely to SALT or if it was simply inevitable due to the growing acceptance and popularity of cryptocurrency and digital assets, it cannot be denied that SALT was an early pioneer of the space. The work of SALT has helped to continue the trend of acceptance and usage of these types of assets, outside of just speculation.

## *Recommendations*

Based on some other competitors, I would recommend SALT offer a savings account option for individuals to earn annual interest, paid out in monthly installments. SALT's competitor Ledn has this as part of its business model. This would benefit SALT by allowing them to create more assets under management which they could use to lend to either an institutional borrower, similar to Ledn [15], or to other customers (both individuals and businesses. This could ultimately increase revenue for with interest payments for these additional loans.
